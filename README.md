# Flower Classification Python Project

## Image Classifier with PyTorch

This project is part of Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, I developed code for an image classifier using PyTorch. The image classifier is designed to identify and classify images from a dataset.

The project is divided into two main parts:
1. **Image Classifier Code:** The initial part involves writing code to build an image classifier using the PyTorch deep learning framework. This includes defining and training a neural network on a given dataset.

2. **Command Line Application:** The second part involves converting the image classifier code into a command line application. This allows users to make predictions using the trained model from the command line.

## Project Structure

- **`image_classifier.ipynb`:** Python notebook containing the code for the image classifier.
- **`train.py`:** Python script for training the neural network.
- **`predict.py`:** Python script for making predictions using the trained model.
